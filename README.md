# pike

Pike is a macro collection to pipe your functions calls, like in F# or Elixir.

## Usage

Put this in your Cargo.toml
```toml
[dependencies]

pike = "0.1.0"
```

Then you can import the macros with extern crate and macro_use
```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate pike;
```

## Examples

```rust
// pipe_res exits the pipeline early if a function returns an Err()
let result = pipe_res!("http://rust-lang.org" |> download |> parse |> get_links)
```

```rust
fn times(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32{
    return a * b;
}

let num = pipe!(
  4
  |> (times(10))
  |> {|i: u32| i * 2}
  |> (times(4))
);

// takes a string length, doubles it and converts it back into a string
let length = pipe!(
    "abcd"
    |> [len]
    |> (as u32)
    |> times(2)
    |> [to_string]
);

// you are allowed to have trailing or preceding `|>` operators.
let length = pipe!(
    "abcd"
    |> [len]
    |> (as u32)
    |> times(2)
    |> [to_string]
);
```

## Macros

- `pipe!` is the "standard" pipe macro
- `pipe_res!` works like `pipe!` but takes only functions that return a `Result` (of the
  same type) and returns early if that result is an Err. Useful for combining multiple IO
  transformations like opening a file, reading the contents and making an HTTP request.
- `pipe_opt!` works like `pipe!` but takes only functions that return an `Option` (of the same type).
  The pipeline will continue to operate on the initial value as long as `None` is returned from all functions.
  If a function in the pipeline returns `Some`, the macro will exit early and return that value.
  This can be useful if you want to try out several functions to see which can make use of that value in a specified order.

## Syntax Features

Any `pipe` starts with an expression as initial value and requires you
to specify a function to transform that initial value.
```rust
let result = pipe!(2 |> times2);
```

You can get more fancy with functions, too, if you add parentheses like
in a normal function call, the passed parameters will be applied to that
function after the transformed value.

> You have to put it in parentheses
because the Rust macro system can be very restrictive.
If you figure out a way to do it without please make a PR.

```rust
let result = pipe!(2 |> (times(2)));
```

You can pass closures \o/! A closure must be wrapped in curly brackets (`{}`)
```rust
let result = pipe!(
  2
  |> (times(2))
  |> {|i: u32| i * 2}
);
```

If you want a function to be called as a method on the transform value,
put it in square brackets (`[]`).
```rust
let result = pipe!(
    "abcd"
    |> [len]
);
```
